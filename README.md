# WordPress Test Setup

This repository contains a basic directory structure for a WordPress site. The actual WordPress source code is not included. To run WordPress, replace the placeholder files with a real WordPress installation.

## Structure
- `wordpress/index.php` – test entry point displaying a placeholder message.
- `wordpress/wp-config.php` – placeholder configuration file.
- `wordpress/wp-content/` – directory for themes and plugins.
- `wordpress/wp-admin/` – admin area placeholder.
- `wordpress/wp-includes/` – WordPress core includes placeholder.

## Usage
Replace the contents of the `wordpress` directory with an actual WordPress distribution. Then configure `wp-config.php` with your database credentials.
